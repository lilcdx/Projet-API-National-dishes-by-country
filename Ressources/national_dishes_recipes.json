         "instructions": "Servings: Makes 50 1/2-inch empanadas Notes: Empanadas are Brazil's national appetizer, tiny pies filled with chicken olives, and peas. Belita's are famous all over Brazil. Empanadas are traditionally made in special molds that are almost as deep as they are wide. If they are unavailable, any small tartlet molds will do. \"The secret to making good dough,\" says Belita, \"is to massage it, not knead it.\" It may look as if she's making mud pies, but the results are truly superb. For the dough: To prepare the dough: Place the flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the center. Place the butter, shortening, eggs, salt, and 1 cup water in the well. Using one hand to mix, squeeze these ingredients through your fingers to make a paste. Gradually work in the flour, squeezing the dough between your fingers to mix it. Add water as necessary; the dough should be quite soft. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes while you prepare the filling. Heat the oil in a large saucepan. Saute the onion and garlic over medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft but not brown. Add the chicken, bay leaf, tomato paste, salt, and pepper, plus water just to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked. Skim off the fat that rises to the surface. Remove the chicken, then strain and reserve the broth. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, discard the skin and remove the meat from the bone. Finely shred the meat with your fingers or in a food processor. Stir in the flour, peas, and olives. Stir in 3 to 4 Tbsp broth; the filling should be moist but not runny. Add enough cayenne to give the chicken a little bite. Pinch off cherry-sized pieces of dough and use them to line the tartlet molds. Belita pushes the dough in with her thumb. The dough should just reach over the top of the mold. Place a spoonful of filling in each crust. Roll out the remaining dough and cut out tops for the empanadas. Try to capture an air bubble when you place the top over the filling; according to Belita, this is what makes the pies light. Seal the tartlets by pinching together the top and bottom crust. Note: The empanadas can be prepared ahead to this stage and frozen. Preheat the oven to 350-F. Brush the tops with egg glaze. Bake for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Unmold and serve."

In a dish, sprinkle the cutlets with lemon juice and let stand for 30 minutes. Season both sides with salt. Place the flour on a flat plate, and place the egg/water mixture in a wide, shallow bowl. Add the oil to the egg mixture and beat in with a fork. Spread the bread crumbs on a large plate. Dip the cutlets lightly into the flour, making sure to coat all surfaces, then gently shake off the excess flour. Dip the cutlets into the egg mixture, letting the excess drip away, and then dredge them in the bread crumbs. Let stand at room temperature for 20 minutes. Heat your largest, heavy skillets over medium-high heat and add the butter. When the butter is quite hot and the foam starts to subside, add the veal (cook in batches if necessary - but don't crowd them in the pan). If the butter browns too much after cooking the first batch, you may need to discard it, wipe out the pan, and add more butter for the next batch. Cook for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, until golden brown, and turn with a spatula (don't use a fork or tongs, or the breading may be pierced). When the second side is golden, the schnitzels should be cooked through. Transfer to a warm platter and keep warm in a 250 degree oven while you cook the second batch, if necessary.

Bring 6 cups of water to a rapid boil in a large, heavy pot. combine the two ingredients and add to the water. Stir constantly for 10-15 minutes -- a process that needs two people for best results: one to hold the pot while the other stirs vigorously with a strong implement (such as a thick wooden spoon). The mixture will become very thick and difficult to stir, but unless you are both vigilant and energetic, you'll get a lumpy mess. When the fufu is ready (or you've stirred to the limits of your endurance!), dump about a cup of the mixture into a wet bowl and shake until it forms itself into a smooth ball.

Does not keep well after tomatoes are added, but will last several days without them and actually improve. Note: When you place seafood in citrus juice, this chemically 'cooks' the seafood. (This is why seafood marinade recipes tell you to marinate the fish for no more than 1/2 hour or so.) However, this process will NOT destroy parasites that might be in the flesh. According to my sources, scallops and shrimp are two seafoods you can trust NOT to have parasites. I have seen many recipes for ceviche that contain other types of white seafood, such as halibut, etc. My butcher (among others) has told me that if you desire to use other types of seafood in ceviche, freezing it for 10 days will kill the parasites."

Depending on how fresh the chick peas are will determine how long this will take. Give them about 1 1/2 hours. Drain well & set aside to cool. When cool, place chick peas in food processor bowl & blend until very smooth. If you have a large enough bowl, add the rest of the ingredients, except the stock, & mix in the blender. If the bowl is not large enough, you will have to do this in batches. Then add the ingredients in order, mixing well after each addition. Add a little stock if the mixture appears too dry or looks as if it is not going to hold together very well. Cover & set aside for 30 minutes. Shape into patties. If the patties do not hold together very well, you may want to add a little more flour, but be careful, you do not want to make them too floury. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet & gently flatten. This amount should make 15 to 18 patties, so make them a reasonable size. Preheat the oven to 350F. Bake the falafel patties for 5 minutes, remove trays, flip the patties & return to the oven for another 5 minutes. Remove from trays & cool on wire racks. To serve: Heat some olive oil in a good heavy skillet, you can choose: I use 2 tb of olive oil, or you could deep fry them in a wok. If using the wok method, crumble one dried red chile into the oil as it is heating. When the oil is hot, fry the falafel patties until golden. Flip & fry the other side. Remove from the oil, drain & serve. Either serve the falafel as part of a Middle Eastern platter including some baba ganouj, hummus, tabouleh, lettuce, tomatoes, green onions & pita. Or, make up a sauce using tahini & hot sauce, warm a pita bread, slice the top off, spread the tahini paste in the pita, drop in two patties, cover with lettuce, tomatoes & green onions. Either a great snack or a main meal."

         "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 240c/475f/Gas 9 and heat a frying pan. 1 Place the mustard seeds in a heatproof bowl and pour over plenty of boiling water. Set aside to soak for 10 minutes or as long as time allows. 2 Add 1 tbsp oil to the frying pan and cook two-thirds of the onion for 2-3 minutes until softened but not coloured, stirring occasionally. 3 Place the beef in a bowl with the tomato puree or ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and an egg. Finely chop two of the gherkins, add to the bowl and mix well to combine. Season to taste. 4 Stir in the cumin and cinnamon in the softened onion and cook for another minute, stirring. Remove from the heat. Tip the onion mixture into the beef and mix until well combined, using your hands. 5 Place 4 x lightly oiled 10cm/4\" cooking rings on a baking sheet and divide the beef mixture among them, pressing down well with the back of a spoon. Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes until cooked through. 6 Thinly slice the potato and place in a pan of boiling salted water. Cover and simmer for 6-8 minutes or until just tender. 6 Place the sugar and 4 tbsp vinegar in a small pan. Drain the mustard seeds, add to the pan and simmer for a minute or two until the sugar has dissolved and the liquid has thickened slightly. 7 Slice remaining gherkins and add to the pan with the rest of the onion. Simmer for another 3-4 minutes until reduced and slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. Season the relish to taste. 8 Heat 1 tbsp oil in a small pan, stir in the flour and cook for a minute, stirring, then gradually pour in the cream, a little at a time, stirring until smooth after each addition. 9 Separate the remaining two eggs and beat in the yolks (reserve the egg whites to use in another dish) with the Dijon mustard. Season to taste. Remove the beef from the oven. 10 Drain the potatoes and arrange them in an overlapping layer on top of the beef mixture. Spoon over some of the sauce mixture and granite under the grill for a minute or two until bubbling and lightly golden. 11 For a Salad Dressing: Place the remaining tbsp of vinegar in a small bowl. Whisk in the remaining 3 tbsp olive oil and season to taste. Place the salad in a bowl and season. 12 Pour over the dressing and toss to coat. Transfer one mini moussaka on to a serving plate, using a fish slice and remove the cooking ring. Arrange some of the relish on the side with a small mound of the salad. Serve at once."

This adaptation for North Americans may trouble you if you try to stick to minimally processed foods. But it's worth trying at least once with west African groundnut stews. Bring 6 cups of water to a rapid boil in a large, heavy pot. combine the two ingredients and add to the water. Stir constantly for 10-15 minutes -- a process that needs two people for best results: one to hold the pot while the other stirs vigorously with a strong implement (such as a thick wooden spoon). The mixture will become very thick and difficult to stir, but unless you are both vigilant and energetic, you'll get a lumpy mess. When the fufu is ready (or you've stirred to the limits of your endurance!), dump about a cup of the mixture into a wet bowl and shake until it forms itself into a smooth ball. Serve on a large platter alongside a soup or stew. "

         "servings": "1 Servings",
         "instructions": "Make sure you have a good-sized roasting tin to fit the goose and a grid to place under it. Preheat the oven to Gas 7, 425F, 218C. You can make the stuffing in advance. Soak the prunes in hot tea (Earl Grey) until soft, stone them and drain, or get pre-stoned ones - easier. Place prunes, vermouth and stock in a saucepan, bring to the boil, then simmer for ten minutes until tender. Strain but reserve the liquid. Melt the butter in a little pan and gently fry the shallots and liver for a couple of minutes, stirring all the while. Place in a mixing-bowl which will hold all the ingredients. Boil the port in the same pan until reduced to two tablespoons, scrape round the sides and add to the liver mixture. Beat the pate, bread crumbs, allspice and thyme together and combine thoroughly with the rest. Season with salt and a good quantity of the pepper. Stir in the prunes. Put the goose in the sink and pour a kettle of boiling water over it. This ensures a good, crisp skin. Remove and dry with kitchen towels. Salt the cavity and fill loosely with the stuffing, then sew up the vent. Prick the skin all over but not the flesh. Place on the grid in the roasting pan and roast breastside up for 15 minutes. Lower heat to Gas 4, 350F, 177C, turn the goose onto its side. Halfway through, turn onto the other side, then for the last 15 minutes onto its back again. Throughout the cooking, baste every 20 minutes with three tablespoons of boiling water and remove the fat from the pan into a bowl. The easiest way to perform both these operations is with a bulb baster. The whole cooking time should be 2 1/2 hours. Test by piercing the thickest part of the thigh: the juices should run pale yellow. When ready, the goose should be put on a very hot dish. Pour off the remaining fat from the roasting pan and make the gravy from the reserved prune liquid, adding it to the residual juices in the pan. Bring to the boil and simmer for a few minutes, adjust the seasoning, strain into a sauce boat and hand round separately."

Remove and discard the woody stems. Stack the collard leaves a few at a time, and cut them crosswise into 1/2-inch wide strips. Bring 1 cup of the water to a boil in a large skillet. Add the collard greens, cover, and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until the greens are barely tender, about 10 minutes. Drain the greens well. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Add the onion and chile pepper and cook over medium heat, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in the drained greens. In a medium bowl, whisk the remaining 3/4 cup water with the lemon juice, flour and salt until smooth. Stir this into the greens, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened and the flour flavor has cooked away, about 3 minutes. Serve immediately. \"There are many ways of making this very simple dish,\" says Maggie Marenga. \"You can use just onions or just tomatoes. You can use heavy cream or half-and-half instead of the water in the lemon sauce. It's great with beef or chicken stew. Some people even put beef or chicken in their Sukuma Wiki. In Kenya, it is eaten on an almost daily basis.\" >From KWANZAA: An African-American Celebration of Culture and Cooking by Eric V.

Cut the chicken in different pieces, wash the chicken with \"naranja agria\" taking out the skin and excess grease. Add onions, garlic, bell pepper, English sauce (or soy sauce), tomatoes and salt. After half an hour, cook the chicken without adding tomato sauce. Add more water than usual so that you can use the resulting sauce. Do not let get the chicken to become too tender. When done, save it in the refrigerator. 2. Cook the pork chops and goat in the same way as the chicken but cook them separately. Add more water than usual so that you can use the resulting sauce. When done, save it in the refrigerator. 3. Cut the \"tocino\" in small pieces (half an inch) and pass it through hot vegetable oil (to give a nice color). Add some water and cook. Do not let get the \"tocino\" to become too tender. 4. Cut the sausage in small pieces (half an inch each) and fry the pieces. Save the vegetable oil. 5. Peel of the yucca, plaintain bananas, malanga, spanish pumpkin, sweet potatoes and white yam and cut them in small pieces. Put them in salt water so that they do not become black. 6. In a large pot (or two medium size pots) put the salt and the water. Add the onions, bell pepper, leaves of parsley and cilantro, spanish pumpkin, corn, plaintain bananas and malanga. When they are getting tender put all the other vegetables, the meat and the \"sauces\". Add two tablespoons of the oil in which the sausage was fried, \"naranja agria\", vinegar, garlic, check the salt. Do not let the sancocho to get too thick. 7. Put the spanish pumpkin in two portions: the first one to add thickness to the \"sancocho\" and the second to eat with the sancocho. If some vegetables are too tender, take them out. When the sancocho is done, put them in again. When done, you can serve the sancocho with rice and add picante sauce (Tabasco, for instance). This recipe is good for 18 portions. Notes: PANTRY: tocino (salt pork, or spanish sausage) yucca (cassava,tapioca,manioc) naranja agria (these are oranges that are very, very sour) auyama (spanish pumpkin, butternut squash, winter squash) puerro (leek, green onion) Malanga (mul-AHNG-uh) (Taro Root)"

You can make this a day or two ahead of time, but do NOT add the tomatoes. The tomatoes should be added fresh an hour or two before serving, or disregarded altogether. Does not keep well after tomatoes are added, but will last several days without them and actually improve. Note: When you place seafood in citrus juice, this chemically 'cooks' the seafood. (This is why seafood marinade recipes tell you to marinate the fish for no more than 1/2 hour or so.) However, this process will NOT destroy parasites that might be in the flesh. According to my sources, scallops and shrimp are two seafoods you can trust NOT to have parasites. I have seen many recipes for ceviche that contain other types of white seafood, such as halibut, etc. My butcher (among others) has told me that if you desire to use other types of seafood in ceviche, freezing it for 10 days will kill the parasites."

         "instructions": "Preface: From The Journey North - Torreon to Chihuahua This part of Chihuahua is quite an important chile-growing area as well, and while the greatest part of the crop is dried, fresh chiles are also used: \"chile de arbol\", \"guajillo\" (confusingly called \"cascabel\" there), \"jalapeno\", and \"chilaca\" or Anaheim. The \"chilaca\", or \"chile verde\", the long slender light green chile that ranges from mild to hot, is the one featured most commonly in the cooking of Chihuahua. While it is used fresh, or dried as \"chile de la tierra\" or \"chile colorado\", there is an interesting variation: it is charred and peeled and then hung up to dry, whole, without removing seeds and veins. In this state it is known as the \"chile pasado\". I warn you, if you do this, 1 pound will reduce to 2 ounces. But it is well worth it because when rehydrated before cooking this chile has a delicious flavor and enhances the stews or \"rellenos\" or \"chile con queso\" in which it is used. In recent years mushroom cultivation has been introduced, and now the preferred filling for \"chiles rellenos\" is a mixture of mushrooms and cheese. The crop of jalapenos, while still green, is mostly destined for the canning industry; once they ripen to red, their value is diminished. Not so many years ago they were simply thrown away in the latter stage, until Don Juventino Santos, an enterprising man from Tulancingo, Hidalgo, who was in the chile business, decided to smoke-dry them for \"chipotle mora\". When we were driving out from Camargo the following day to visit the Lago Toronto, the air was filled with the aroma of smoke and chiles, andd there, a few yards from the roadside, were huge rectangular cement-block structures about twelve feet high. At intervals around the base were fire boxes filled with glowing, smoking logs. Spread out in a thin layer over the slatted surface were deep red, wrinkled jalapenos - the color darkens as the smoking process progresses. A man with a shovel was turning them over from time to time. The farther we drove out of twon, the more small communities (\"ejidos\") we saw and visited that were also dedicated to smoking chiles, and as we drove back that afternoon there were trucks tipping out their loads of the ripened jalapenos onto the newly vacated smoking beds. This smoke-drying process takes several days in which time the weight of the chiles is reduced to one seventh that of the fresh. The smoked chiles are so cheap that one wonders how on earth anyone makes any money out of it at all. We bought sackfuls to support the local economy and distributed them lavishly to all the cooks we knew along the route back and in Michoacan. They were extraordinarily picante, owing to the hot, dry summer. A recipe for them pickled \"en escabeche\" can be found in \"The Art of Mexican Cooking\", and following is a recipe for chipotles \"en adobo\". Preserving chiles by smoke-drying dates from pre-columbian times, and the basic process, albeit with slightly different techniques is still used today. Jalapeno chiles - ripened, smoke-dried, and prepared in a pungent sauce for chipotles \"en adobo\" - have taken the American gastronomic world by storm. They are everywhere, the condiment of the decade, mixed with anything and everything: in sauces, seasoning pastes, soups, salads, breads, etc. (not yet I sincerely hope, in ice cream). There are two types of \"chipotles\": the larger, highly smoked, tobacco-colored one and the smaller mulberry-colored (as the name implies) \"mora\" - not to be confused with \"moritas\", which are smaller. When I first came to Mexico many years ago, the larger light-colored chiles were more in evidence, canned in a light pickle, \"escabeche\". Today the canning industry seems to favor the \"mora\", possibly because its smaller size lends itself to the small cans. Of the many brands exported from Mexico, my preference is for those packed in a darker-colored sauce, a real \"adobo\", rather those in a more acidic, tomato-based sauce. Of course, it is always interesting to make your own, without preservatives and fresh, for which I give a recipe here. This preparation is pungent; a milder version is given in the note that follows the recipe. Rinse the chipotle chiles and drain. Pierce each one right through with a continued in part 2"

Heat the water until lukewarm and mix in a little of the ngaiwa, stirring well to prevent lumps. Bring to a boil, always stirring and reduce the heat. Allow the mixture to boil gently for a few minutes. It should look like a thin transparent porridge. Sprinkle in the remaining ngaiwa, 'pang'ono pang'ono' (little by little), stirring continuously to avoid lumps from forming. There is a trick to the stirring and this is where the mtako or flat wooden paddle or spoon come in handy. Malawians mash the mixture against the side of the pot with each stir. This breaks up the lumps. The stirring will become difficult but don't give up. You want to reach a thick, smooth consistency. One that will hold its shape.

         "instructions": "1. Soak the bread crumbs in the half and half for 5 minutes in a large mixing bowl. 2. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small skillet over low to moderate heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the onions and saute them for about 2 minutes. Let cool slightly. 3. Add the beef, veal, pork, egg nutmeg, salt, pepper, and onions to the bread-crumb mixture. Gently combine the ingredients with your hands. 4. Cover the bowl and refrigerate the mixture for a couple of hours. 5. Shape the meat mixture with your hands into uniform 2/3-inch balls. Arrange them on a plate in one layer so they do not touch each other. Let the meatballs stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. 6. Melt the remaining butter in a saute pan or skillet over moderate heat. When the foam starts to subside, add the meatballs. (Do not crowd the pan; unless your pan is oversized, you will have to cook gthe meatballs in batches and keep the cooked ones warm in a preheated 200 degree F oven.) Saute the meatballs for about 5 minutes until they become brown on all sides. Turn them as necessary, but do so gently. 7. Transfer the 'koettbullar' to a warm platter and serve immediately. Serves 8."
